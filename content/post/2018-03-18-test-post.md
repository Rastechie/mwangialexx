Created in R studio using Hugo and the blogdown package by the phenomenal [Yihui Xie](https://twitter.com/xieyihui). You can create your own blog by reading his immensely helpful [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). 

The theme is the minimal **hugo-tanka** by [Nan Xiao](https://twitter.com/road2stat). You can download it [here](https://github.com/road2stat/hugo-tanka).
